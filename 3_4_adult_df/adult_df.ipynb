general most people prefer to work full-time, regardless age and material-status, with the exception of people over the age of 35, who have been widowed. The latter are split nearly 50/50 (delta=+/-2 people).\n\nAlso, people over the age of 35 seem to be more likely to have married, and in consequence more likely to have been separated, divorced, or widowed.
